## Short Notes
**Solutions to Avoid Lost Updates:**

**1. Pessimistic Locking (Explicit Locks)**

    Lock the record when someone reads it, so no one else can read or write until the lock is released.
    Example: SELECT ... FOR UPDATE in SQL.
    Prevents concurrency but can reduce performance due to blocking.

**2. Optimistic Locking (Versioning)**

    Common and scalable solution.
    Each record has a version number or timestamp.
    When updating, you check that the version hasnâ€™t changed since you read it.
    If it changed, you reject the update (user must retry).

    Example:
    UPDATE products
    SET price = 100, version = version + 1
    WHERE id = 1 AND version = 3; --3

**3. Serializable Isolation Level**
    In database transactions, using the highest isolation level (SERIALIZABLE) can prevent lost updates.
    But it's heavier and can cause performance issues (due to more locks or transaction retries).

**Which Solution is Best?**
- For web apps and APIs: Optimistic locking is often the best balance (fast reads + safe writes).
- For critical financial systems: Pessimistic locking may be safer.
