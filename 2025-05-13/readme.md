## Short Notes

**Locking Mechanism**
- PostgreSQL automatically applies locks, but you can control them manually when needed.

**MVCC VS Locks**
- MVCC allows readers and writers to work together without blocking.
- Locks are needed when multiple writers try to touch the same row or table.

**Simple Rule of Locks**
- Readers donâ€™t block each other.
- Writers block other writers on the same row.
